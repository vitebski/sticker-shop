# Sticker Shop - Architecture and Design Document

## Overview

Sticker Shop is a full-stack e-commerce application for selling stickers. It follows a modern web application architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend components.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with the following main components:

1. **Frontend**: React-based single-page application (SPA)
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js RESTful API
3. **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL database)
4. **Deployment**: Vercel-optimized configuration

```

## Backend Architecture

### API Layer

The backend follows a RESTful API design pattern with the following endpoints:

- `/api/auth` - Authentication and user management
- `/api/products` - Product management
- `/api/categories` - Category management
- `/api/cart` - Shopping cart operations
- `/api/orders` - Order processing
- `/api/payment` - Payment processing

The API is designed to be stateless, with each request containing all the information needed to complete the operation.

### Data Models

The application uses MongoDB with Mongoose ODM and includes the following data models:

1. **User** - User account information and authentication
2. **Product** - Product details including name, description, price, and inventory
3. **Category** - Product categorization
4. **Cart** - Shopping cart items for users
5. **Order** - Order details and status

### Middleware

The backend implements several middleware components:

- **Authentication** - JWT-based authentication
- **File Upload** - Image upload handling with Multer
- **Error Handling** - Centralized error handling
- **Database Connection** - MongoDB connection management with circuit breaker pattern
- **CORS** - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration

### Serverless Optimization

The backend is optimized for serverless deployment on Vercel:

- `/api/index.js` serves as the serverless entry point
- Connection pooling is optimized for serverless environments
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Caching headers for improved performance

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure

The frontend follows a component-based architecture using React:

- **Layout Components** - Header, Footer, etc.
- **Page Components** - Individual pages of the application
- **UI Components** - Reusable UI elements
- **Routing Components** - Route protection and navigation

### State Management

The application uses React Context API for state management:

- **AuthContext** - User authentication state
- **CartContext** - Shopping cart state

### Routing

React Router is used for client-side routing with the following route types:

- **Public Routes** - Accessible to all users
- **Private Routes** - Requires user authentication
- **Admin Routes** - Restricted to admin users

### Performance Optimization

The frontend implements several performance optimizations:

- **Code Splitting** - Lazy loading of page components
- **Suspense** - Loading indicators during component loading
- **Caching** - API response caching where appropriate

## Deployment Architecture

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel with the following optimizations:

- **Serverless Functions** - Backend API runs as serverless functions
- **Static Site Hosting** - Frontend is served as static assets
- **API Routing** - Custom routing for API endpoints
- **Caching Headers** - Optimized caching for static assets
- **Connection Pooling** - Database connection management for serverless environment

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures:

- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing** - Secure password storage with bcrypt
- **Input Validation** - Validation of user inputs
- **CORS Configuration** - Controlled cross-origin access
- **Security Headers** - HTTP security headers

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. **Search Functionality** - Enhanced product search capabilities
2. **User Reviews** - Product review and rating system
3. **Wishlist** - User wishlist functionality
4. **Analytics** - Sales and user behavior analytics
5. **Multi-language Support** - Internationalization
6. **PWA Features** - Progressive Web App capabilities

## Conclusion

The Sticker Shop application follows modern web development practices with a clear separation of concerns, scalable architecture, and optimizations for performance and security. The design allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
